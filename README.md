# MIR_Reinforcement-Learning
This repository contains MIR-Courses about the implementation of Reinforcement Learning using Gymnasium API.

In the TP_01 code, I explore the gymnasium and learn how to use the Gymnasium. Here, I focus on exploring about environment atrributes of Frozen Lake Model. I break down th environment into several attributes, such as States, Actions, and the Outcomes.

In the TP_02 code, I delve deeper into the the Frozen-Lake Model, where I try to implement different methods on calculating the state value such as direct method, naive method monte carlo first visit method, monte carlo every visit method, monte carlo incremental method, and time-differences method. I also do a policy improvement method and implement it to a policy learning pethod such as SARSA and Q-Learning.
